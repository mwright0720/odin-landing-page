    <div class = "testimonial"><p class = "quote"> Little Busters! quite literally changed my life. Before reading Little Busters!, I was an insensitive fool who hurt others feelings by merely existing. After reading Little Busters!, I feel a new sense of being. It is as if Little Busters! completely changed my perspective on life. After reading Little Busters!, I felt reborn. However, I also felt a little sad. Sad that I wouldn't ever be able to experience something as profound and life-changing as Little Busters! was. But because I read Little Busters!, I am at peace with this idea. I now know that wanting every piece of fiction to do what Little Busters! did to me is an unsatisfiably greedy request. Instead, I should be happy that I was able to experience something as great as Little Busters!, and I should be grateful for the lasting effect that Little Busters! has had on my way of thinking. Little Busters! has legitimately made me appreciate fiction more than I have ever before, and for that alone, I am grateful. Thank you, Little Busters!, I am happy I was able to find the game that changed my life.</p></div>
